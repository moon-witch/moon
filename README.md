# Moonwitch Portfolio

This is my open-source portfolio to show off my work, skills and art.  
Feel free to dig around in the code.

## Stack

I am using Nuxt for the frontend and self-hosted Directus as a headless CMS / backend.  
For the Directus Backend I use Docker.
As a preprocessor for my CSS I use Sass.  
All components / UI elements are built from scratch.
